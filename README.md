A To-Do List in JavaScript is a web application that allows users to create
and manage a list of tasks. Built using the JavaScript programming language, 
it allows users to add new tasks, mark tasks as complete, and remove tasks.
The list is dynamically updated as the user interacts with the application,
providing a simple and intuitive interface for task management. The application
can be built using vanilla JavaScript or with the help of a front-end framework
such as React or Angular. It can be a great starting point for those who are learning
JavaScript and want to build a functional and practical application
